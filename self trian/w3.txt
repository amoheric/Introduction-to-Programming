Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML:

<!-- Write your comments in HTML here -->
 
CMMT IN JS // or between /* and */ 

An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.

 // Declare 3 variables
 // Assign the value 5 to a
 // Assign the value 6 to b
 // Assign the sum of a and b to c

var	          =Declares a variable
let	          =Declares a block variable
const	=Declares a block constant
if	          =Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
switch	=Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
for	          =Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
function	=Declares a function
return	=Exits a function
try	          =Implements error handling to a block of statements


Encoding translates numbers into binary. Character sets translates characters to numbers.

JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.

let x;                 // Now x is undefined
x = 5;                // Now x is a Number
x = "John";      // Now x is a String



From this second week's discussions, I learned that functions are built and used across multiple programming languages—all start with Modules, a group of statements that perform specific tasks within a program.

Modules can be called whenever it is needed in the program; to execute a module, you have to call it. They do contain a header and a body used in Javascript files with certain plugins. But unlike the function, which is almost the same as a module but returns a value back to the program, while modules do not. Functions work in a systematized order like input, processing, and then output, respectively.

Functions are built-in and inherited from a programming language or console, such as mathematical functions, data type conversion functions, formatting, and the string function.  

Boolean values help distinguish between only two comparable outcomes, which can be either true or false. 

It is also important that a programmer makes their code easy to read by making use of the white spaces which the console doesn't even notice, as well as leaving possible comments.
