Notable Styling Choices:

- I opted for a warm color palette to evoke the cozy, welcoming atmosphere of our café.
- Typography: “Georgia’,‘Merriweather’,‘Times New Roman “ font is used for headings, and “ Times, serif “ for body text, balancing readability with style.
- The site is fully responsive, with media queries ensuring it looks great on devices of all sizes, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
